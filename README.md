## Model Uploader

This project stemmed from another project where I as tasked to develop an online application that mimicked a very complex Xcel forecasting model. The problem was that the Xcel model was continually being developed and changed several times per year. In order to built longevity into my application, I developed the model uploader which allowed me upload any Xcel spreadsheet and convert it into a calculation script with custom inputs and outputs. This approached solved the problem of needing to adapt to frequent changes to a very large forecasting model (25,000+ values and calculations).
